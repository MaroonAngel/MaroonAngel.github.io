                    <br>
                    <p>We've been in the moving industry for over 12 years.

                    <p>"They were able to accommodate a super last minute booking. The movers were careful and worked hard. I felt like I can trust the movers with my stuff. Highly recommend this company!"</p><p class="customer-name"> - Sarang Young from Salt Lake City, Utah</p>                    
                    <p>"Mark and his crew were awesome. Friendly, professional and got the job done with no problems. Moving is stressful and such a pain -- but not with The Movers 123. I highly recommend these movers!!!"</p><p class="customer-name"> - Stephanie Bell of Layton, Utah</p>
                    <p>"The Movers 123 made our move stress free. They came when they said they would, dove right into packing up our massive amount of belongings and carefully packed the truck to the absolute limit. They worked until the job was done even though we had underestimated how long we would need them. I will use them again and recommend them for any moving and packing needs."</p><p class="customer-name"> - Maureen Martin of Bountiful, Utah</p>
                    <p>"I contacted The Movers 1-2-3 through Yelp on a Saturday at 10 PM explaining that I would need help the next morning. To my surprise, the owner, Kingsley, responded to my message within minutes and was able to fit me into their schedule and did not charge me any "rush fees." He was very friendly and helpful.</p><p class="customer-name"> - Daniel Rogers of Murray, Utah</p>
